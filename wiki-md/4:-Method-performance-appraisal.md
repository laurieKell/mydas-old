Develop set of diagnostics that can be applied across range of models. Also assess the stability of the model, sensitivity to assumptions and bias in the advised catch.

## Management Strategy Evaluation
 
Conducting a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) requires six steps \citep[after][]{punt2007developing}; namely i) identification of management objectives; ii) selection of hypotheses for the OM; iii) conditioning the OM based on data and knowledge, and possible weighting and rejection of hypotheses; iv) identifying candidate management strategies; v) running the Management Procedure (MP) as a feedback control in order to simulate the long-term impact of management; and then vi) identifying the MPs that robustly meet management objectives. 

### Operating Models

There are many alternative ways to condition Operating Models which we use to represent resource dynamics

One way is to use a stock assessment. 
- This implies that the assessment is able to describe nature almost perfectly
- If this is true why bother with MSE? 

Basing an OM on the current assessment model has arguably the lowest demands for knowledge and data and allows the tRFMOs to make a phased transition from the stock assessment paradigm to a risk based approach. If a management procedure can not perform well when reality is as simple as implied by an assessment model it is unlikely to perform adequately for more realistic representations of uncertainty about resource dynamics. 

### Data Rich
Take a stock assessment of a data rich stock and create an Observation Error Model (OEM) that mimics the properties of a data poor dataset.

### Life History
Use life history relationships to create an OM based on ecological theory
