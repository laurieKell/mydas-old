The service provider is required to link research output to the following projects: 

* The International Council of the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is in the process of developing methods to identify MSY proxy reference points for data-limited stocks (WKLIFE and WKPROXY series of workshops). The service provider is required to contribute to this process by proposing and testing new assessment models and methods of establishing reference points and will be expected to attend up to 4 one-week meetings at ICES headquarters in Copenhagen. However there are key differences with the ICES approach: 

* This research contract will include stocks not currently assessed by ICES;
this research contract will focus on the available data for each stock first and on the methods second; the ICES approach focuses on the methods first and then applies a limited number of methods to a large number of stocks.
Marine Institute research and development on data poor stocks which includes the biology, stock dynamics and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for Pollock.  It is expected that the service provider will collaborate closely with the team developing assessment methods for the pollock stock.

* Galway Mayo Institute of Technology MIT had been awarded a Cullen fellowship for a PhD project on management strategy evaluation for monkfish. It is expected that the Cullen PhD and service provider will closely collaborate on tasks like data collation, assessment model implementation, simulation model development and management strategy evaluation.
